This repository contains code to replicate results in the paper:
    
    Lippold, Kye (2019). "The Effects of the Child Tax Credit on Labor Supply." 
    Available at SSRN. https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3543751

Researchers may also find the code helpful because it creates a data file of [Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sipp.html) data linked to [Taxsim](https://users.nber.org/~taxsim/taxsim32/), providing information on imputed tax liabilities in the SIPP from 1984 to 2016. 

Comments and pull requests are welcome.
